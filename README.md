# ksrc

**One‑liner search and read for Kotlin 3rd-party dependency sources for AI agents.**

Your AI agents take ~10 steps just to see a single Kotlin function's signature in a third-party library. `ksrc` turns that into two commands and ~4x less tokens.

## What it is

It's a CLI utility to enable efficient source code search for AI agents working with Kotlin.

Ever saw an AI agent find a function's signature in TypeScript/Python? Simple `rg` over `node_modules` and a `sed` call is all it needs to discover APIs and
signatures.

With Kotlin/Gradle, agents have to take a 15-step journey to download, locate, unpack and ripgrep source jars.
`ksrc` turns 16k tokens wasted on that into 2 CLI commands.

## Install

We currently publish standalone binaries via GitHub Releases. (Brew and other packages in progress ⚙️)

Install script (macOS/Linux):
